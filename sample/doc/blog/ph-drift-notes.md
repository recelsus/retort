A three-litre glass reactor hums away on a bench in an older building. We charge acetate, a measured splash of acetic acid, and a catalyst that sulks if the medium wanders too alkaline. By mid-morning the pH has crept upwards and the yield slips. The fix is not exotic; it lies in maintaining a slim column of carbon dioxide above the liquor and calibrating electrodes just before the batch.

Electrodes age quietly. A non-rhotic mentor once told me, "keep the bulb moist, lad," and the advice still holds. We keep a calendar in the lab journal, logging the slope and offset from each two-point calibration. Any drift beyond two millivolts sends the probe for a soak in mild acid, and if that fails, we replace it without debate.

Gas management matters too. A gentle bleed of carbon dioxide from a cylinder maintains an atmosphere that discourages hydroxide pickup from open air. The flow is low enough to avoid stripping solvent yet firm enough to keep a protective blanket. In small rooms this also demands a quick sniff of the scrubber line each day.

These small rituals feel old-fashioned, but they stabilise the kinetics and keep the batch tidy. It is chemistry at its most modest: care, patience, and a steady eye on the logbook.

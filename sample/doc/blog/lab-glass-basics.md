Every new cohort of students arrives convinced that polymer vessels and disposable tips have made borosilicate flasks quaint. Yet a close look at routine titrations shows why tempered glass endures. The smooth surface resists adsorption, so subtle colour shifts in an acidâ€“base end-point stay honest rather than bleeding through stained walls.

Glass also tolerates gentle flame polishing, letting us renew chipped mouths without consigning a vessel to landfill. In a non-rhotic voice you would hear in Cambridge, I remind trainees: "heat the lip, let it glow, then let it cool." The ritual slows the day, yet it prevents the hairline fractures that release solvent at the worst moment.

There is a sustainability angle too. A round-bottom flask can survive decades of reflux runs if we mind our clamps and never forget the thin film of silicone on the joint. That longevity matters when procurement teams push for single-use sachets in the name of convenience.

So the next time you prepare a buffer, give the glass a rinse with distilled water, watch the droplets sheet away, and feel the quiet authority of a material that has guided chemists long before we worried about automation scripts.

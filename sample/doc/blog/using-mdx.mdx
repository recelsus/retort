MDX lets a chemist narrate an experiment and drop in a small JSX helper without leaving the page. Below we explore buffer capacity for a simple acetate system and show how an inline component can highlight the pH trend.

## Scenario

We titrate 50 mL of 0.1 mol L⁻¹ acetic acid with 0.1 mol L⁻¹ sodium hydroxide. The Henderson–Hasselbalch relation predicts the pH as we add base. A mentor from Oxford, with a non-rhotic cadence, used to say, "let the maths guide the beaker." That line still echoes whenever I reach for the burette.

```js
const measurements = [
  { addedMl: 0, pH: 2.87 },
  { addedMl: 10, pH: 3.74 },
  { addedMl: 25, pH: 4.75 },
  { addedMl: 40, pH: 5.66 },
  { addedMl: 50, pH: 8.72 },
];
```

We can map those data into a tiny JSX table.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Base added / mL</th>
      <th>Measured pH</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {measurements.map((row) => (
      <tr>
        <td>{row.addedMl.toFixed(1)}</td>
        <td>{row.pH.toFixed(2)}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

The key takeaway is how gently the pH rises near the half-neutralisation point and how sharply it leaps once we pass equivalence. Combining prose and JSX in MDX keeps the reasoning and the data in one tidy document.

## Tips for lab notes

- Keep numerical arrays small so reviewers can scan them without scrolling.
- Add units to column headings; future you will appreciate the discipline.
- Remember that MDX renders on the server in Astro, so any dynamic bits should stay deterministic.

With these habits you can publish lab reflections that blend human context with structured data, all while staying in a single `.mdx` file.
